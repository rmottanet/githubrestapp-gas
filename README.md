# GithubRestApp

GithubRestApp is a Google Apps Script library that provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the GitHub API. Built on the [GithubHttpApp](https://github.com/ws2git/githubhttpapp-gas) HTTP request project, it offers specific functions for each API endpoint, simplifying integration with GitHub in your projects.


## Features

* **Endpoint abstraction:** Interact with the GitHub API in a simple and intuitive way, with specific functions for each endpoint.
* **Error handling:** We deal with common errors, such as failed authentication and rate limits, to ensure the robustness of your application.


## Limitations

Limited by the capabilities of the Google Apps Script.
